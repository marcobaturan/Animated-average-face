# Animated average face

The objective of this project is the generation of a two-dimensional 
animated avatar based on the facial average of 122 samples. 
Parts of these, 80 exactly, belong to a project on the average face 
per country or ethnicity registered in a previous project. 

I consider the most reasonable way to give artificial intelligence a 
face based on all ethnicity, country, age and gender. 
Even though an AI has none of those traits it is itself a product of 
all humanity.

It also offers a more human interface and one that everyone can identify 
with and empathize with without any sense of feeling underrepresented or 
discriminated against.

You can also generate your own average face, just follow the instructions below.

- Put front pictures of the faces in the folder /faces_for_average
- python3 virtualenv venv\
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python main.py
